# Mobile Robotic Arm for Object Manipulation
**Scholarship in Software and Hardware, Engineering Center Cluj (Bosch Engineering Center Cluj)**

## Description
In this project, I am constructing a **mobile robotic arm** for object manipulation, remotely controlled via wireless connection. The project involves both hardware and software components to create a fully functional system.

## Project Goals
- **Develop** a mobile robotic arm capable of manipulating objects.
- **Design** and build a **PCB** that integrates all necessary modules into a single board.
- **Implement** wireless remote control functionality for the robotic arm.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**:
  - PCB design (KiCad)
  - Microcontrollers (ESP32)
  - Motors, sensors
- **Software**:
  - Embedded C/C++
  - Control algorithms
  - Wireless communication (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)

## Hardware Design
### Mobile Robotic Arm
The robotic arm consists of:
- **Motors**: Used for movement in multiple axes.
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 for servo motors&movement motors control via Blynk app
- Arm and body components and wheels
  
### PCB Design
The PCB integrates:
- **Microcontroller** ESP32
- **Power Supply Module**
- **H-bridge** for motor control

## How to Control the Robot
- Use Blynk app(web or mobile app) to control the arm remotely.

## Future Improvements
- Add **vision-based object recognition** for autonomous manipulation.
- Enhance control precision using **feedback loops**.
